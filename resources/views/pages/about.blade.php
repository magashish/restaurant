                    <h1>Whatâ€™s the Foodapp Story?</h1>
                    <p>In 1 June of 2020, Foodapp began operations by signing up a few restaurants in California, Florida. Soon enough, the first team of Hunger Saviors came into action to deliver food within 40 minutes. Shortly after, Foodapp raised its first round of funding and launched the app in July of 2020. Fun fact: The technology that delivers great food right to your doorstep was completely developed in-house!</p>
<p>With love and support from consumers, Foodapp expanded far and wide, first through the entire city of California and then across the entire country. As they say, the rest is history.</p>

<p>Today, Foodapp is the leading food ordering and delivery platform in India. The innovative technology, large and nimble delivery service, and exceptional consumer focus at Swiggy enabled a host of benefits that includes lightning fast deliveries, live order tracking and no restrictions on order amount, all while having the pleasure of enjoying your favourite meal wherever you'd like it.</p>
